/**
 * This tracks one recording of a {@link TraceContext}. Common implementations include span
 * reporting (ex to Zipkin) and data manipulation, such as redaction for security purposes.
 *
 * <h3>Relationship to Span lifecycle</h3>
 * The pair of {@link #begin} and {@link #end} seems the same as the span lifecycle. In
 * most cases it will be the same, but you cannot assume this.
 *
 * <p>A {@link TraceContext} could be recorded twice, for example, if a long operation
 * began, called {@link Span#flush()} (recording 1) and later called {@link Span#finish()}
 * (recording 2). A {@link TraceContext} could be abrupted by garbage collection resulting in a
 * {@link Cause#ABANDON}. A user could even {@linkplain Cause#ABANDON abandon} a span without
 * recording anything!
 *
 * <p>Collectors that process finished spans will need to look at the {link Cause} and {@link
 * MutableSpan} collected. For example, {@link Cause#FINISH} is usually a good enough heuristic to
 * find complete spans.
 *
 * <h3>Advanced Notes</h3>
 * <p>It is important to do work quickly as callbacks are run on the same thread as application
 * code. However, do not mutate {@link MutableSpan} between callbacks, as it is not thread safe.
 *
 * <p>The {@link TraceContext} and {@link MutableSpan} parameter from {@link #begin} will be
 * the same reference for {@link #end}.
 *
 * <p>If caching the context or span parameters between callbacks, consider a {@link WeakReference}
 * to avoid holding up garbage collection.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #begin} callback primarily supports tracking of children, or partitioning of
 * data for backend that needs to see an entire {@linkplain TraceContext#localRootId() local root}.
